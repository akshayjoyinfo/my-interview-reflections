# 🚀 My Journey: From Code to Cloud Excellence

"Hi, I’m Akshay Panthallookaran Joy, and my journey in technology has been all about building, optimizing, and scaling software that truly makes an impact."

## 💡 The Beginning – A Passion for Engineering
My passion for technology started early. I pursued Computer Science Engineering at the University of Calicut, where I was always drawn to solving complex problems. I won three Best Project Awards, and during the rise of social networking, I built an alumni website—a clone of Orkut & Facebook in 2010. That experience taught me not just coding but the power of scalable systems and user engagement.

## 🛠 The Builder’s Journey – From Software Developer to Cloud Architect
I started my career at NTT DATA Global Services, where I worked on .NET applications and cloud integrations, but I was always eager to take on larger challenges.

At DeltaX, an AdTech startup, I led the Tracking Team, overseeing a 10TB data migration to Azure and implementing real-time AWS EMR Spark processing. This was my first deep dive into high-scale, performance-sensitive applications, and it made me realize how much I loved working with cloud infrastructure, distributed systems, and big data processing.

## 🌍 Mastering Enterprise Cloud – Navigating Logistics & Finance at Scale
As I progressed in my career, I took on roles at Optum (UHG) and JP Morgan, where I worked on modernizing enterprise systems.

At Maersk, I led the redesign of the Container Shipment Tracking System, making it more scalable and resilient while ensuring uninterrupted service for global supply chains. I introduced Datadog monitoring, K6 performance testing, and led the migration from Azure DevOps to GitHub Actions, improving deployment automation and system reliability.

This was where I truly honed my expertise in cloud-native architectures, microservices, and DevOps.

## 🚀 The European Chapter – Building the Future of Logistics Data at Xeneta
In 2023, I moved to Hamburg, Germany, taking on the role of Principal Lead Engineer at Xeneta, a company revolutionizing ocean freight analytics.

Here, I:
- ✅ Designed an event-driven Rate Management System, scaling data ingestion using AWS, Kafka, and microservices.
- ✅ Reduced execution time from all-day processing to real-time AWS Batch executions, optimizing costs and efficiency.
- ✅ Developed QuickSight dashboards, helping businesses make data-driven pricing decisions in logistics.

This role solidified my expertise in platform scalability, cloud automation, and event-driven systems.

## 🎯 The Next Chapter – Why Apaleo?
Now, I’m looking for a new challenge—one where I can combine my experience in platform engineering, DevOps, and event-driven systems to build even more impactful solutions.

Apaleo’s API-first, cloud-native platform with 35+ microservices communicating via Kafka is exactly the kind of environment where I thrive. My experience in .NET, AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, and observability tools like DataDog aligns perfectly with the role of Senior Staff Engineer.

I’m excited about:
- Improving platform reliability & observability by defining best practices and proactive monitoring strategies.
- Optimizing cloud infrastructure costs, making the platform more efficient and sustainable.
- Empowering engineering teams by building self-service infrastructure and scalable CI/CD pipelines.

## 🔥 My Mission as a Senior Staff Engineer
For me, engineering isn’t just about writing code—it’s about building resilient, scalable, and high-impact systems that drive business success.

Apaleo is at the forefront of redefining hospitality tech, and I’m eager to bring my experience in distributed systems, platform automation, and cloud engineering to help scale its platform and enhance its capabilities.

I look forward to the opportunity to contribute and help Apaleo grow! 🚀
